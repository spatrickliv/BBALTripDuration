* 02-04-2018: I made quite a few modificaitons since last time, and I need to use commits better to track them all. I cleaned the code in both file and renamed them. I updated the model with PairBand and year as random effects, modified the coding of interactions to get better convergence. As it is the model seem to run well but I won't run more tests before we have the final data.

# TODO list for the DHGLM model

* check interaction coding (Done)
* add pair random effect in variance part of the model (Done) 
* check data structure (Sam)
* run model with convergence
* check priors and starting values
* Write a paper


# More serious TODO list

* discuss the value of having PairBand and year as random effect in both part of the model
